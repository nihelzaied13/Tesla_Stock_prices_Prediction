# Tesla_Stock_prices_Prediction


This project uses time series models (LSTM and ARIMA) to predict Tesla stock prices. The objective is to build an accurate forecasting model that helps investors and analysts estimate future stock price trends.

### Overview
This project aims to forecast future Tesla stock prices based on historical data. Two machine learning models are used:

##### LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):
A type of recurrent neural network capable of capturing long-term patterns in time series data.
##### ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average):
A statistical model that captures trend and seasonality in stationary data.

The models are compared to determine which provides the most accurate predictions.

##### Data
The data used for training and predictions includes historical Tesla stock prices.
